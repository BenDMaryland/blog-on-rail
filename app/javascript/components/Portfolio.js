                        <p className="descrip" >A project management application where teams can create projects track progress create KBA's and see live feedback of team members performance. My final project for FlatIron. For this I wanted to create a project where I could track my own progress as I built the application. || Currently a work in progress to be completed january 6th </p>
                       <h2>Difficulties  </h2>
                        <p className="descrip" >My two biggest challenges for this project were, figuring out how to create the methods to track progress in the backend, and adding the teams functionality.  </p>
                        <h2>Solutions </h2>
                        <p className="descrip" >For serving data in the correct format I had to learn some new Ruby methods for managing time. Mainly, this allowed me to segregate data based on the dates which then allowed me to create the graphs to track progress. As for the teams functonality, that is a work in progress</p>

One of the best choices I made here was to  make code that works, even if it isn't scalable or following  best practices. and refactor later. This really helped me progress the app and learn more. </p>
